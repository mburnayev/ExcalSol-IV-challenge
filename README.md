# README
An implementation of the provisioned interview coding challenge\
**Due end of day Wednesday, September 3, 2025**

## Project Specifics
### Assumptions
- I imagine the interview challenge doc is confidential, so it should probably not go in this repository
- I should probably keep this repository private until the day of presentation (or just add my IVers?)
- I can use *any* non-AI software tools and services, but my backend code still has to be written (in Java or Python)
- I can create arbitrary records as soon as a user is created [confirmed]
- Considering that I'm created a gradebook that's only viewable by students, implementing just GET/reads is sufficient [confirmed]
